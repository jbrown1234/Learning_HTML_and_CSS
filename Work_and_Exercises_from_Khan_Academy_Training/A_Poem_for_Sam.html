    <h1>Dog Farts, a Poem for Sam</h1>
    <p>He breaketh wind like a red sun rising in the east <em>frightening</em> sailors and woodland creatures<br>
        The odor bears the tones of something unholy, shaking the righteous and scores of preachers<br>
        <em>The cloud of ass is <strong>creeping death</strong></em>, bringing tears to shroud all you can see here<br>
        What comes in the wake is semi-formless and shuns earthly features
